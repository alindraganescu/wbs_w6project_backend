        "description": "EOS.IO is a blockchain protocol based on the cryptocurrency EOS. The smart contract platform claims to eliminate transaction fees and also conduct millions of transactions per second.   \nWhat Is EOS?\n\nEOS is a blockchain-based, decentralized system infrastructure that enables the development, hosting, and execution of commercial-scale decentralized applications (dApps) on its platform. No official full form exists for EOS, and the creators have decided not to formally define it themselves. \nKey Takeaways\n\nEOS is a blockchain decentralized system infrastructure that enables the development of decentralized applications (dApps).\nEOS supports secure access and authentication, permissioning, data hosting, usage management, and communication between the dApps and the Internet.\nThe EOS ecosystem has two key elements: the EOS.IO and the EOS tokens.\nThe EOS.IO is the system architecture, and the EOS token is the network's cryptocurrency.\nEOS has some potential, but Ethereum is its main competitor and is currently more popular.\n\nUnderstanding EOS\n\nEOS supports all of the required core functionality that allows businesses and individuals to create blockchain-based applications in a way similar to web-based applications. EOS provides secure access and authentication, permissioning, data hosting, usage management, and communication between the dApps and the Internet.\n\nEOS is also supported by a web toolkit for interface development, making it a complete offering for hassle-free app development. It essentially works in a way similar to Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store.\nThe Basics of EOS.IO and EOS Tokens\n\nThe EOS ecosystem is composed of two key elements: the EOS.IO and the EOS tokens.\n\nThe EOS.IO is akin to the operating system of a computer—it manages and controls the EOS blockchain network. EOS.IO uses blockchain architecture for vertical and horizontal scaling of dApp. The EOS token is the cryptocurrency of the EOS network.\n\nA developer simply needs to hold EOS coins, instead of spending them, to use network resources and to build and run dApps. A token holder who is not running any apps can also allocate or rent their bandwidth to other participants who may need it.\n\nCurrently owned by the Block.one organization, EOS was launched by Dan Larimer, who is also the founder and creator of established platforms like Bitshares and Steem.\nHow Is EOS Different from Blockchain Systems?\n\nWhile there are already a number of blockchain-based networks like Ethereum, which facilitates decentralized applications, EOS focuses on critical pain points of blockchain and attempts to solve the problem of speed, scalability, and flexibility that often become a bottleneck.\n\nWith the size of the dApps ecosystem increasing with every passing day on a particular blockchain network, there is often limited availability of resources on the network. They include problems like network constraints due to a large number of false transactions and similar requests, spamming apps, slow execution speeds, and limited computing power availability across the network.\n\nEOS.IO attempts to address these problems by offering more scalability, flexibility, and usability through its unique mechanism.\nCharacteristics of EOS.IO\n\nEOS.IO claims to be able to support thousands of commercial-scale dApps without hitting performance bottlenecks through the use of parallel execution and asynchronous communication methodology across the network. The efficiency is further boosted by separate modules that are involved in the working of dApps. For example, the authentication process is performed separately from the execution process.\n\nEOS.IO offers flexibility in the development and maintenance of dApps through various features. Its ownership structure promotes free usage by the user. Transaction charges are eliminated as developers can use resources in proportion to their stake instead of the standard pay-per-transaction model. This also makes it easier for app developers to predict hosting costs and monetize strategies.\n\nEOS.IO uses delegated proof-of-stake and a role-based permissions concept for flexibility in instant high-level decisions; for example, rollback, freezing, and bug-fixing broken apps through a majority accord among designated stakeholders.\n\nEOS has key usability features—a web toolkit for interface development, self-describing interfaces, self-describing database schemas, and a declarative permission scheme. All of these make the developer’s job of creating and maintaining the apps easier.\nThe Democratic Inflation-Based Economy of EOS\n\nThe EOS setup does not use the mining concept. Rather, there are only block producers who generate the required number of blocks and are rewarded by the creation of new EOS tokens for each new block they produce.\n\nBlock producers have the flexibility to publish a desired figure for their expected pay, and the number of tokens they create is calculated based on the median value of the expected pay published by all block producers.\n\nAs block producers would obviously desire higher pay, this feature can easily be misused. To contain this issue, a mechanism caps producer awards tokens so that the total annual hike in token supply will not exceed 5%. Token-holders, who vote on the matter, have the authority to vote out block producers who demand more inflation.\n\nThis mechanism functions complementary to EOS storage as all token holders pay for file storage on the EOS network through a portion of annual inflation. As long as they are storing a file on the network, their EOS tokens will be held up and will lose value at the rate of inflation.\n\nThe more storage required, the more blocks will be demanded from the block creators who can demand more value for their work through higher pay inflation, which the token holders approve. If storage demand decreases, inflation will be lower, reducing the loss of value from held up EOS tokens.\nUnique Year-Long Token Distribution\n\nEOS took a novel approach with a year-long initial coin offering (ICO) period. According to EOSCollective, EOS token distribution spread tokens far and wide throughout the whole ecosystem at realistic market prices without giving undue advantage to a select few during a short ICO period. The distribution was as follows:\n\n200 million (20%) of tokens were initially distributed during a five-day period from June 26, 2016 to July 1, 2017.1\n700 million (70%) of tokens are currently being distributed on an ongoing basis of 2 million per day for 350 days.1\n100 million (10%) are being held in escrow for block.one to keep their incentives in line with that of the EOS community. Block.one's tokens will vest over a 10-year period at 10 million tokens a year.\n\nEOS tokens can be kept in multiple wallets that include Ethereum Wallet, MyEtherWallet, and MetaMask, and the tokens can be traded on exchanges like Bitfinex and YoBit.\n\nEOS faces criticisms concerning its centralized block producers. The system is reportedly supporting large token holders, or whales, in China.\nEOS Developments\n\nIn September 2019, one of the small companies instrumental in the initial development EOS stepped away saying that it was focusing on other blockchain and EOSIO software implementation.  According to Coindesk, the real reason was that the support of EOS whales—those with large token holdings—was needed to make money, and those whales were supporting block producers in China. This did not bold well for EOS.2\n\nEOS faces skepticism in other ways too. Shortly after its launch, block producers froze seven accounts that held stolen tokens, but EOS had no legitimized authority to do so. This move illustrates the current controversy surrounding EOS, which is that it lacks an effective governance process.2\n\nIn June 2019, Brock Pierce, an early member of the Block.One team, made news when he suggested that EOS is now governed by a “Chinese oligarchy.” Although, it is true that a majority of the block producers are based in China, the concern has more to do with the risks that this centralization poses. The main complaints about the current block produders are that they don’t prioritize building new dApps that will attract other users to the blockchain.2\n\nRegarding governance, EOS has since settled on a system in place to run a vote across all EOS holders, but EOS New York said that it is “simply a way of gauging the interest of holders.”2\n\nIn May 2021, the EOS price climbed 50% after the news that Block.one had created a new subsidiary called Bullish Global. The price then fell just as sharply toward the end of the month.3 Bullish Global intends to create a new blockchain-based cryptocurrency exchange. Prominent investors in Bullish Global are Peter Thiel, Mike Novogratz, Alan Howard, Christian Angermayer, Louis Bacon, Richard Li, and the institutions Nomura and Galaxy Digital.\n\nEOS made little news in 2020 because Bitcoin dominated the market's attention. However, developers at Block.one recently announced the EOS Resource Model proposal and that a review of its code by various organizations would be forthcoming.\n\nAnother highlight is that Spielworks built a rewards and loyalty platform for gamers using EOS.IO. Also, the company added new features to its Training and Certification segment of the blockchain. EOS is continuing to attract people to develop new decentralized finance (DeFi) projects on its network, although Ethereum is still the most popular network in that space. ",

        "description": "Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency that is a fork of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash is a spin-off or altcoin that was created in 2017.\n\nIn November 2018, Bitcoin Cash split into two cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV.\n\nSince its inception, Bitcoin users had maintained a common set of rules for the cryptocurrency. In 2017 a group of bitcoin activists, investors, entrepreneurs, developers, and largely China-based miners were unhappy with Bitcoin's proposed SegWit improvement plans meant to increase bitcoin's capacity and pushed forward alternative plans which would increase the block size limit to eight megabytes through a hard fork. Segwit controversially would later enable second layer solutions on bitcoin such as the Lightning Network, and this controversy would eventually lead to the split that created Bitcoin Cash. Supporters of a block size increase were more committed to an on-chain medium of exchange function. A key difference of opinion between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin camps was over the running of nodes. Bitcoin supporters wanted to keep blocks small so that nodes could be operated with less resources, while some large block supporters find it acceptable that (due to large block sizes), nodes might only be run by universities, private companies and nonprofits.\n\nIn June 2017, hardware manufacturer Bitmain, described the would-be hard fork with the increased block size as a \"contingency plan\", should the bitcoin community decide to fork implementing SegWit. The first implementation of the software was proposed under the name Bitcoin ABC at a conference that month. In July 2017, mining pool ViaBTC proposed the name Bitcoin Cash. In July 2017 Roger Ver and others stated they felt that adopting BIP 91 (that would later activate SegWit) favored people who wanted to treat bitcoin as a digital investment rather than as a transactional currency. The fork that created Bitcoin Cash took effect on 1 August 2017. In relation to Bitcoin it is characterized variously as a spin-off, a strand, a product of a hard fork, an offshoot, a clone, a second version or an altcoin.\n\nA Hong Kong newspaper likened this to a new version of word processing software saying:\n\nBitcoin cash is like a new version of Microsoft Word, which generates documents that can no longer be opened via the older versions.\n\nAt the time of the fork anyone owning bitcoin came into possession of the same number of Bitcoin Cash units. The technical difference between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin is that Bitcoin Cash allows larger blocks in its blockchain than Bitcoin which, in theory, allows it to process more transactions per second. Bitcoin Cash was the first of the Bitcoin forks, in which software-development teams modified the original Bitcoin computer code and released coins with “Bitcoin\" in their names, with \"the goal of creating money out of thin air\". On 1 August 2017 Bitcoin Cash began trading at about $240, while bitcoin traded at about $2,700. On 20 December 2017 it reached an intraday high of $4,355.62 and then fell 88% to $519.12 on 23 August 2018.\n\nIn 2018 Bitcoin Core developer Cory Fields found a bug in the Bitcoin ABC software that would have allowed an attacker to create a block causing a chain split. Fields notified the development team about it, and the bug was fixed.\n\nIn November 2020, there was a second contested hard fork where the leading node implementation, BitcoinABC, created BCHA.\nControversy\n\nIn 2017 there were two factions of Bitcoin supporters: those that supported large blocks and those who preferred small blocks. The Bitcoin Cash faction favors the use of its currency as a medium of exchange for commerce, while the Bitcoin-supporting faction view Bitcoin's primary use as that of a store of value. Bitcoin Cash is sometimes also referred to as Bcash. Bitcoin Cash detractors call the cryptocurrency \"Bcash\", \"Btrash\", or \"a scam\", while its supporters maintain that \"it is the pure form of Bitcoin\".\n\nBryan Kelly, a stock analyst likened it to a software upgrade:\n\nBitcoin cash is doing a “hard fork” or “effectively a software upgrade”, Kelly said on “Fast Money”. “When you do a software upgrade, everybody usually agrees. But in this particular case, everybody is not agreeing.”\n\nSamson Mow of Blockstream pointed to Bitcoin Cash's use of the \"Bitcoin\" name as a source of animosity between the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash camps. Emin Gün Sirer, a professor at Cornell stated that Bitcoin Cash was focused on use and Bitcoin was \"enormously\" focused on store of value.",

        "description": "Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system, currency exchange and remittance network created by Ripple Labs Inc., a US-based technology company. Released in 2012, Ripple is built upon a distributed open source protocol, and supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodities, or other units of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes.[2] Ripple purports to enable \"secure, instantly and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks.\" The ledger employs the native cryptocurrency known as XRP.\n\nIn December 2020, Ripple Labs and two of its executives were sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for selling XRP tokens, which the SEC classified as unregistered securities.\n\nRipple was conceived by Jed McCaleb and built by Arthur Britto and David Schwartz who then approached Ryan Fugger who had debuted in 2005 as a financial service to provide secure payment options to members of an online community via a global network.[4][5] Fugger had developed a system called OpenCoin which would transform into Ripple.[6][7] The company also created its own form of digital currency referred to as XRP to allow financial institutions to transfer money with negligible fees and wait-time.[8] In 2013, the company reported interest from banks for using its payment system.[9]\n\nBy 2018, over 100 banks had signed up, but most of them were only using Ripple's XCurrent messaging technology, while avoiding the XRP cryptocurrency due to its volatility problems.[10] Representatives of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), whose market dominance is being challenged by Ripple, have argued that the scalability issues of Ripple and other blockchain solutions remain unsolved, confining them to bilateral and intra-bank applications.[10] A Ripple executive acknowledged in 2018 that \"We started out with your classic blockchain, which we love. But the feedback from the banks is you can’t put the whole world on a blockchain.\"[11]\n\nRipple relies on a common shared ledger, which is a distributed database storing information about all Ripple accounts. Chris Larsen told the Stanford Graduate School of Business that the network was managed by a network of independent servers which compare their transaction records, and that servers could in theory belong to anyone, including banks or market makers.[6] Ripple validates accounts and balances instantly for payment transmission and delivers payment notification within a few seconds.[12] Payments are irreversible, and there are no chargebacks.[13]\n\nRipple Labs continued as the primary contributors of code to the consensus verification system behind Ripple, which can \"integrate with banks’ existing networks.\"[14] Since 2013, the protocol has been adopted by an increasing number of financial institutions to \"offer an alternative remittance option\" to consumers.[15] By December 2014 Ripple Labs began working with global payments service Earthport, combining Ripple's software with Earthport's payment services system. The partnership marked the first network usage of the Ripple protocol.[16] On December 29, 2017, XRP briefly became the second largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of US$73 billion.",

        "description": "Dogecoin (/ˈdoʊ(d)ʒkɔɪn/ DOHZH-koyn or DOHJ-koyn,[3] code: DOGE, symbol: Ð) is a cryptocurrency created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system as a joke, making fun of the wild speculation in cryptocurrencies at the time.[4] Despite its satirical nature, some consider it a legitimate investment prospect. Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the \"Doge\" meme as its logo and namesake.[5][6][7] It was introduced on December 6, 2013, and quickly developed its own online community, reaching a market capitalization of US$85,314,347,523 on May 5, 2021.[2][8]\n\nDogecoin.com promotes the currency as the \"fun and friendly internet currency\", referencing its origins as a joke.\n\nOriginally formed as a joke,[10] Dogecoin was created by IBM software engineer Billy Markus and Adobe software engineer Jackson Palmer. They wanted to create a peer-to-peer digital currency that could reach a broader demographic than Bitcoin. In addition, they wanted to distance it from the controversial history of other coins.[11] Dogecoin was officially launched on December 6, 2013, and within the first 30 days, there were over a million visitors to Dogecoin.com.[12]\n\nPalmer is credited with making the idea a reality. At the time, he was a member of the Adobe Systems marketing department in Sydney.[13] Palmer had purchased the domain Dogecoin.com and added a splash screen, which featured the coin's logo and scattered Comic Sans text. Markus reached out to Palmer after seeing the site, and started efforts to develop the currency. Markus had designed Dogecoin's protocol based on existing cryptocurrencies Luckycoin and Litecoin,[14] which use scrypt technology in their proof-of-work algorithm.[15] The use of scrypt means that miners cannot use SHA-256 bitcoin mining equipment, and instead must use dedicated FPGA and ASIC devices for mining which are known to be more complex to produce.[16][17]\n\nOn December 19, 2013, Dogecoin jumped nearly 300 percent in value in 72 hours, rising from US$0.00026 to $0.00095,[18] with a volume of billions of Dogecoins per day. This growth occurred during a time when bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies were reeling from China's decision to forbid Chinese banks from investing into the bitcoin economy.[14] Three days later, Dogecoin experienced its first major crash by dropping by 80% due to this event and to large mining pools exploiting the small amount of computing power required at the time to mine Dogecoin.[19]\n\nOn December 25, 2013, the first major theft of Dogecoin occurred when millions of coins were stolen during a hack on the online cryptocurrency wallet platform Dogewallet.[20] The hacker gained access to the platform's filesystem and modified its send/receive page to send any and all coins to a static address.[21][22] This hacking incident spiked tweets about Dogecoin, making it the most mentioned altcoin on Twitter at the time, although it was in reference to a negative event. To help those who lost funds on Dogewallet after its breach, the Dogecoin community started an initiative named \"SaveDogemas\" to help donate coins to those who had them stolen. Approximately one month later, enough money was donated to cover all of the coins that were stolen.[23]\n\nIn January 2014, the trading volume of Dogecoin briefly surpassed that of Bitcoin and all other crypto-currencies combined. However, its market capitalization remained substantially behind that of Bitcoin. Initially, Dogecoin featured a randomized reward that is received for each mining block. However, in March 2014, this behaviour was later updated to a static block reward.\n\nIn April 2015, Jackson Palmer announced plans to take an \"extended leave of absence\" from the cryptocurrency community.[24][10]\n\nDuring 2017 to early 2018 cryptocurrency bubble, Dogecoin briefly reached a peak of $0.017/coin on January 7, 2018, putting its total market capitalization near USD 2 billion.\n\nIn July 2020, the price of Dogecoin spiked following a TikTok trend aiming to get the coin's price to $1.[25]\n\nIn January 2021, Dogecoin went up over 800% in 24 hours, attaining a price of $0.07, as a result of attention from Reddit users, partially encouraged by Elon Musk and the GameStop short squeeze.[26] In February 2021, Dogecoin hit a new high price of $0.08 following Twitter encouragement from Musk, Snoop Dogg and Gene Simmons.[27] In March 2021, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban announced his NBA team would allow purchasing tickets and products with Dogecoin; within two days, Cuban had declared his franchise had become the top Dogecoin merchant, having carried out 20,000 transactions.[28]\n\nIn April 2021, Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies surged, stimulated in part by the direct listing for cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase on April 14, although that platform did not provide trading of Dogecoin.[29] Its price first reached $0.10 on April 14,[30] before hitting a new high of $0.45 on April 16 (up 400% that week[31]), with a volume of nearly $70 billion traded in the preceding 24 hours.[32] At the time, Dogecoin's market capitalization approached $50 billion, making it the fifth-highest-valued cryptocurrency;[33] its value had increased more than 7,000% year-to-date.[32] Interest in Dogecoin contributed to an outage in electronic trading platform Robinhood's cryptocurrency system on April 15, caused by \"unprecedented demand\", and prompted concerns from experts of a nearing speculative bubble in the cryptocurrency market.[31]\n\nOn May 4, 2021, the value of Dogecoin first surpassed the symbolic hurdle of $0.50,[34] a greater than 20,000% increase in one year.\n\nOn May 8, 2021, despite, or perhaps because of expectations of a surge in interest in Dogecoin resulting from Elon Musk's appearance on Saturday Night Live, Dogecoin dropped 34% from $0.711 at the opening of the show to below $0.470 45 minutes later. By the following morning Dogecoin hit a swing low of $0.401, a cumulative drop of 43.6% and lost value of $35 billion.[citation needed]\n\nOn May 9, 2021, SpaceX announced a rideshare mission to the Moon completely funded by Dogecoin, thus becoming the first space mission funded by a cryptocurrency. Elon Musk confirmed this news via Twitter.[35] DOGE-1 will be a minor 40 kg rideshare payload on Intuitive Machines' IM-1 mission in Q1 2022.\n",

        "description": "Cardano is a public blockchain platform. It is open source and decentralized, with consensus achieved using proof of stake. It can facilitate peer-to-peer transactions with its internal cryptocurrency Ada.\n\nCardano was founded in 2015 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. The development of the project is overseen and supervised by the Cardano Foundation based in Zug, Switzerland.\n\nBackground\nThe platform began development in 2015 and was launched in 2017 by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum. Hoskinson left Ethereum after a dispute with its co-founder Vitalik Buterin; Hoskinson wanted to accept venture capital and create a for-profit entity while Buterin wanted to keep it running as a nonprofit organization. After leaving he co-founded IOHK, a blockchain engineering company, whose primary business is the development of Cardano, alongside the Cardano Foundation and Emurgo. The platform is named after Gerolamo Cardano and the cryptocurrency after Ada Lovelace.\n\nTechnical aspects\nAtypically, Cardano does not have a white paper. Instead it uses design principles intended to improve upon issues faced by other cryptocurrencies, such as scalability, interoperability, and regulatory compliance.\n\n3. Cardano uses a proof-of-stake protocol named Ouroboros in contrast to Bitcoin and Ethereum which use proof-of-work protocols. Proof-of-stake blockchains use significantly less energy than proof-of-work chains. In February 2021, Hoskinson estimated the Cardano network used 6 GWh annually, less than 0.01% of the 110.53 TWh used by the Bitcoin network as estimated by the University of Cambridge. Cardano is considered the biggest proof of stake cryptocurrency in 2021.\n\nWithin the Cardano platform, Ada exists on the settlement layer. This layer is similar to Bitcoin and keeps track of transactions. The second layer is the computation layer. This layer is similar to Ethereum, enabling smart contracts and applications to run on the platform. Cardano's smart contract language allows developers to run end-to-end tests on their program without leaving the integrated development environment or deploying their code.\n\nHistory\nCardano was funded through an initial coin offering. The currency debuted with a market cap of $600 million. By the end of 2017, it had a market cap of $10 billion, and reached a value of $33 billion briefly in 2018 before a general tightening of the crypto market dropped its value back to $10 billion. According to Mashable, Cardano claims that it overcomes existing problems in the crypto market: mainly that Bitcoin is too slow and inflexible, and that Ethereum is not safe or scalable.\n\nIOHK has partnered with universities for blockchain research. In 2017, IOHK helped the University of Edinburgh launch the Blockchain Technology Laboratory. In 2020, IOHK donated $500,000 in Ada to the University of Wyoming to support the development of blockchain technology.\n\nIn 2019, the Ministry of Education in Georgia signed a memorandum of understanding with the Free University of Tbilisi to use Cardano and Atala to build a credential verification system for Georgia.\n\nIn 2019, footwear manufacturer New Balance announced a pilot program on the Cardano blockchain to track the authenticity of its newest basketball shoe.\n\nIOHK announced a partnership with the Ethiopian government in 2018 to deploy their technology in a variety of industries throughout the country. In April 2021, IOHK and the Ethiopia Ministry of Education announced plans to launch an identity and record-keeping system on Cardano for the country's five million students.",

        "shortText": "Ethereum (ETH) has been moving downwards since May 12, when it reached an all-time high price.",
        "myText": "Despite the ongoing bounce, there are not enough signs to predict a bullish reversal.\nOngoing decrease\n\nETH has been moving downwards since reaching an all-time high price on May 12. The decrease has been sharp, culminating with a low of $1730 on May 23. This amounted to a 60.50% decrease in only 11 days. \n\nLong-term indicators are bearish. While the RSI has generated hidden bullish divergence, both the MACD & Stochastic oscillator are moving downwards, the latter having made a bearish cross (red icon).\n\nIn the weekly time-frame, the main support level is found at $1400, which is the previous all-time high resistance area.\n\nThe daily chart shows the ongoing bounce since May 19.\n\nHowever, ETH has been thrice rejected by the $2850 resistance area, which coincides with the 0.382 Fib retracement resistance level.\n\nDespite showing some bullish signs, technical indicators are still bearish. \n\nThe RSI is below 50 and the Stochastic oscillator is decreasing, despite having made a bullish cross. The MACD is also negative.\nWave count\n\nThe wave count indicates that ETH is in a long-term wave four (red), of a bullish impulse that began in Dec. 2020. \n\nWhile it has bounced at the 0.618 Fib retracement support level at $1,775, it is not yet clear if wave four has reached its bottom. \n\nThe next support area is at $1,030, the 0.786 Fib retracement support level. \n\nThe shorter-term chart shows that the decrease from the all-time highs is a five wave structure. Therefore, it means that it is likely only the first part of a larger corrective structure, which would complete the previously outlined wave four. \n\nAs a result, an increase towards $3370-$3814 could transpire before another low is reached.\n\nSource: https://beincrypto.com/when-will-eth-reach-a-new-all-time-high/ ",

        "title": "Lack of crypto regulations alarming, says Italy's stock market regulator",
        "myText": "Crypto growing to a $1.6 trillion market without adequate regulations is a major worry for the head of Italy’s stock market oversight agency.\n\nPaolo Savona, the chairman of the Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa (Consob) — Italy’s securities regulator — has raised alarms over crypto’s growing popularity in the absence of firm regulatory standards.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Savona made this position known while delivering Consob’s annual report on Monday stating that the lack of clear-cut regulations creates an opportunity for criminals to utilize crypto for illegal activities. According to Savona:\n\n    “Without proper oversight, there could be a worsening in market transparency, the basis of legality and rational choice for (market) operators.”\n\nDespite several research studies indicating that crypto criminality only accounts for a minute proportion of global cryptocurrency commerce, Savona has joined the chorus of financial regulators pushing the virtual currency crimes agenda.\n\nEl Salvador’s recent parliamentary vote to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender has drawn criticism from several legacy finance gatekeepers. In the Netherlands, one Dutch official has called for a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies.\n\nSpeaking during the CNBC Squawk Box program earlier on Monday, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz alluded to the emerging narrative, calling it “a tug of war between adoption and regulation.”\n\nFor Savona, criminals using crypto for money laundering and tax evasion are not the only problem. According to the Consob chairman, the proliferation of cryptocurrencies poses an existential threat to the ability of central banks to facilitate the sovereign monetary policies of their respective nations.\n\nRelated: Dutch official calls for complete ban on Bitcoin\n\nGiven the extent of Savona’s crypto fears, the securities regulator panned the slow pace of activities concerning cryptocurrency regulations at the European Union level. The Consob chief stated that Italy could be forced to establish its own regulatory framework if the European Union takes too long to develop a region-wide set of laws.\n\nHowever, not all the happenings on the crypto regulatory front are negative for the industry. Indeed, reports coming out of India suggest that the authorities have moved away from plans for a total ban towards more nuanced regulations. Even in the Netherlands, Dutch finance minister Wopke Hoekstra has spoken in favor of supervision instead of the prohibition of cryptocurrencies.\n\nSource: https://cointelegraph.com/news/lack-of-crypto-regulations-alarming-says-italy-s-stock-market-regulator",

        "myText": "A stunning BTC price surge accompanies concerns over the United States Federal Reserve's \"institutional credibility.\"\nBTC price breaks out past $40,000\n\nData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD gaining 3% in under an hour, reaching $40,600 on Bitstamp.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency capitalized on the upside that resulted from a new positive tweet by Elon Musk concerning Tesla possibly accepting BTC in the future.\n\nEarlier, Cointelegraph reported on traders betting on a leg up to around $47,000 before a correction.\n\nA look at buy and sell positions on major exchange Binance shows support at $38,000, with resistance at $40,500 — the next hurdle for bulls.\nPaul Tudor Jones advocates 5% BTC allocation\n\nBitcoin reached a $2 trillion market capitalization because of a \"dichotomy\" in Federal Reserve policy that \"questions\" its credibility, said famous trader Paul Tudor Jones.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on June 14, the founder of Tudor Investment Corporation sounded the alarm over advancing inflation.\n\nAfter last week's consumer price index (CPI) report showed that United States inflation has hit a 13-year high, Bitcoin's deflationary nature has rarely looked so appealing.\n\nFor Jones, the idea that higher inflation is just temporary due to recent events — as suggested by the Fed and central banks in general — is a myth.\n\n\"It's somewhat disingenuous to say that inflation is transitory — for them to say inflation is transitory,\" he told CNBC's Squawk Box segment.\n\nToday's environment is entirely different from those that saw episodes of inflation in the past, such as in 2013. As such, there is little sense in the Fed applying the same forecasts, Jones believes.\n\nJones noted that the CPI was much lower then, while now, unemployment levels and job offers also roughly equal each other.\n\nRelated: Paul Tudor Jones says Bitcoin is 'like investing early in Apple or Google'\n\nMeanwhile, gold and Bitcoin have provided a refuge for many. Despite the precious metal vastly underperforming Bitcoin in terms of gains, it remains near record highs.\n\n\"When you look at the Fed today and the Fed back then, you wonder: How can you have such wildly different policy views on what constitutes the right levels for employment, the right levels for inflation?\" he continued.\n\n    \"How can you have that with an eight-year timeframe? It's almost like a split personality. And you wonder why Bitcoin has a $2 trillion market cap and gold's at $1,865 an ounce. And the reason why is because you have this dichotomy in policy that again questions — questions —  the institutional credibility of something.\"\n\nUltimately, a 5% Bitcoin allocation is one of the only things he recommends to those seeking portfolio advice.\n\n\"I say, 'OK, listen. The only thing that I know for certain is I want to have 5% in gold, 5% in Bitcoin, 5% in cash, 5% in commodities at this point in time,'\" he added.\n\nSource: https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-hits-40k-as-paul-tudor-jones-slams-fed-inflation-claims \n",

The company said it plans to use these proceeds, which it estimates at $488 million — after discounts, comissions and expenses — to buy more bitcoin.\n\nThe offering was of secured notes due 2028 that bear interest at an annual rate of 6.125%.\n\nThe company already holds 92,079 bitcoin, which is under the purview of its newly formed subsidiary MacroStrategy. The price of bitcoin is currently $40,700, suggesting that MicroStrategy will be able to buy around 11,990 more bitcoin, taking it well above the 100,000 mark.\n\nMicroStrategy announced this latest offering on June 7, initially planning to raise $400 million before it was upped to $500 million. According to reports, the company had more than $1.6 billion worth of orders for the notes, \"including interest from a large number of hedge funds.\"\n\nSource: https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/108334/microstrategy-completes-500-million-offering-plans-to-buy-more-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptopanic&utm_medium=rss",

        "description": "Bitcoin (₿) is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The currency began use in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software.\n\nBitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services, but the real-world value of the coins is extremely volatile. Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimated that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin. Users choose to participate in the digital currency for a number of reasons: ideologies such as commitment to anarchism, decentralization and libertarianism, convenience, using the currency as an investment and pseudonymity of transactions. Increased use has led to a desire among governments for regulation in order to tax, facilitate legal use in trade and for other reasons (such as investigations for money laundering and price manipulation).\n\nBitcoin has been criticized for its use in illegal transactions, the large amount of electricity (and thus carbon footprint) used by mining, price volatility, and thefts from exchanges. Some economists and commentators have characterized it as a speculative bubble at various times. Bitcoin has also been used as an investment, although several regulatory agencies have issued investor alerts about bitcoin.\n\nThe word bitcoin was defined in a white paper published on 31 October 2008. It is a compound of the words bit and coin. No uniform convention for bitcoin capitalization exists; some sources use Bitcoin, capitalized, to refer to the technology and network and bitcoin, lowercase, for the unit of account. The Wall Street Journal, The Chronicle of Higher Education, and the Oxford English Dictionary advocate the use of lowercase bitcoin in all cases.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin)",

        "description": "Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether (ETH or Ξ) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. After Bitcoin, it is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Ethereum is the most actively used blockchain.\n\nEthereum was proposed in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin. In 2014, development was crowdfunded, and the network went live with an initial supply of 72 million coins on 30 July 2015. The platform allows developers to build and operate decentralized applications that users can interact with. Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications provide a broad array of financial services without the need for typical financial intermediaries, such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks, allowing cryptocurrency users to borrow against their holdings or lend them out for interest. Ethereum also allows for the creation and exchange of NFTs, which are non-interchangeable tokens connected to digital works of art or other real-world items and sold as unique digital property. Additionally, many other cryptocurrencies operate as ERC-20 tokens on top of the Ethereum blockchain and have utilized the platform for initial coin offerings.\n\nIn 2016, a hacker exploited a flaw in a third-party project called The DAO and stole $50 million of Ether. As a result, the Ethereum community voted to hard fork the blockchain to reverse the theft and Ethereum Classic (ETC) continued as the original chain.\n\nEthereum has started implementing a series of upgrades called Ethereum 2.0, which includes a transition to proof of stake and aims to increase transaction throughput using sharding.",
